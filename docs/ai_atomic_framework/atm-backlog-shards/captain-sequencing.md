## Current Captain Sequencing Ruling

As of 2026-06-14, the recommended order is:

1. Return to Team Agents with `TASK-TEAM-0002` as the first implementation card. It is the smallest useful product slice: dry-run crew briefing, no runtime writes, no subagent spawning.
2. Run `TASK-TEAM-0004` through `TASK-TEAM-0006` next if the goal is visible usability and the 90-minute first-card promise.
3. Insert `TASK-RFT-0008` before making `taskflow` or task-card lifecycle behavior heavier, because it is the smallest RFT card and directly supports safer task operations.
4. Insert `TASK-RFT-0003` before Team runtime cards (`TASK-TEAM-0011+`) or framework temp-claim expansion, because that module owns high-risk lifecycle behavior.
5. Keep MAO route work at the light prerequisite layer already landed. Do not continue broad MAO implementation before the Team Agents thin slice unless a blocker appears.
6. Treat full Runner Broker as long-term north-star. Use the lightweight Runner Sync Steward lane first for generated `release/**` governance.
